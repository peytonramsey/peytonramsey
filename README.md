About Me

I'm a recent graduate from UNH's Peter T. Paul College with a BS in Business Administration, specializing in Information Systems & Business Analytics. What started as uncertainty about my path transformed into a genuine passion for data science and machine learning during my junior year - a discovery that not only improved my academic performance but also led to my acceptance into UNH's MS in Business Analytics program, which I'll begin this fall.

What I Do

I'm passionate about data visualization and turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My experience as a BI & Data Intern at Sprague Energy taught me how to translate business needs into analytical solutions, building star schema data models and creating Power BI dashboards that drive decision-making.
